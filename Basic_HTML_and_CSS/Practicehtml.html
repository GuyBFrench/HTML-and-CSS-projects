			<p>Oh Senor Don <span style="color:Brown;font-weight:bold;">Gato</span> was a cat<br>
				On a high red roof Don <span style="color:Brown;font-weight:bold;">Gato</span> sat<br>
				He went there to read a letter,<br>
				Meow, meow, meow<br>
				Where the reading light was better,<br>
				Meow, meow, meow<br>
				'Twas a love note for Don <span style="color:Brown;font-weight:bold;">Gato</span><br>

				I adore you wrote the lady cat<br>
				Who was fluffy, white and nice and fat<br>
				There was not a sweeter kitty,<br>
				Meow, meow, meow<br>
				In the country or the city,<br>
				Meow, meow, meow<br>
				And she said she'd wed Don <span style="color:Brown;font-weight:bold;">Gato</span><br>
